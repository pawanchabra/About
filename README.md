# About
Hi there I'm Pawan ChabraðŸ‘‹ A Frontend Developer based in Mumbai, India. I graduated from Wilson College in Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, tho everything that I know for the web is through self-learning. Currently, I work at Pepper Content. While I'm not coding, you can find me playing chess or FPS games, reading fictional books, or binging on Netflix.  I also casually blog on topics that I learn.
